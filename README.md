# Racket Dialogue Tree
## What is this
A simple implementation of an interactive dialogue tree in the Racket language.  
The JSON is parsed into a hashmap. Console input decides how we branch across the flattened tree until we reach a leaf node.

##  How to run
```bash
Racket main.rkt story.json
```
